## Game State Autoloads
##
## This serves as a global proxy for network state and modes of play.
##
## In many cases, the functions are a simplified version of what W4 already
## offers, and therefore some people may make the choice of reducing this proxy
## autoload a lot and using W4 directly.
##
## Both approaches are fine, but we believe this proxy clarifies intent by
## reducing possibilities.
